        Docker is an open-source platform used for automating the deployment,
        scaling, and management of applications. It allows applications to run
        in isolated containers, which are lightweight and portable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Docker simplifies the process of developing, shipping, and running
        applications, as it provides a consistent environment regardless of the
        underlying system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Docker uses a client-server architecture, where the Docker client
        communicates with the Docker daemon, which in turn manages the
        containers.

      <img src="./Assets/docker/3.jpg" width="400">
      <p>
        Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous
        integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        It allows developers to automate the entire build, test, and deployment
        process of their applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jenkins provides a web-based interface for configuring and managing
        build jobs, which can be triggered by various events such as code
        changes or scheduled intervals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins and integrations, making it
        highly customizable and extensible.

      <img src="./Assets/docker/5.png" width="400">
      <p>
        YAML is a human-readable data serialization format. It stands for "YAML
        Ain't Markup Language."
      </p>
      <p>
        YAML is commonly used for configuration files and data exchange between
        languages or systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        It provides a simple syntax that is easy to read and write, making it
        popular for defining complex data structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        YAML files consist of nested key-value pairs and can include lists and
        maps.
      </p>
      <p>The .yml file extension is commonly used to indicate that a file contains data written in YAML format. However, it is important to note that the choice of file extension (.yml or .yaml) does not affect the content or the way YAML is interpreted. Both .yml and .yaml files can be used interchangeably.</p>

      <h1>Docker Image and Docker Container</h1>
      <h3>Docker Image</h3>
      <p>
        An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package
        that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including
        the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Images can be built using Dockerfiles, which are text files that specify
        the steps to create an image.
      </p>
      <h3>Docker Container</h3>
      <p>
        A container is an instance of an image that can be run, started,
        stopped, moved, and deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Containers provide an isolated and reproducible environment for running
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each container runs independently of other containers, with its own
        resources and filesystem.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>run and CMD Command in Dockerfile</h1>
      <h3>RUN Command</h3>
      <p>
        The RUN command is used in a Dockerfile to execute commands during the
        build process of an image.
      </p>
      <p>
        It allows you to install dependencies, compile code, and perform other
        build-time tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each RUN command creates a new layer in the image, and the result of the
        command is saved in that layer.
      </p>
      <h3>CMD Command</h3>
      <p>
        The CMD command is used in a Dockerfile to specify the default command
        that should be run when a container is started from the image.
      </p>
      <p>
        It defines the main executable for the container. Only the last CMD
        instruction in a Dockerfile has an effect.
      </p>

    <div class="container mt-4">
        <h2>Command: docker pull vats/website</h2>
        <p>
            This command is used to pull the Docker image "vats/website" from the Docker Hub registry.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Command: docker images</h2>
        <p>
            This command lists all the Docker images that are currently available on your system.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Command: docker scout quickview vats/website</h2>
        <p>
            This command provides a quick summary view of the Docker container associated with the image "vats/website".
        </p>
    
        <h2>Command: docker ps</h2>
        <p>
            This command lists all the running Docker containers on your system.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Command: docker stop 0a53</h2>
        <p>
            This command stops the Docker container with the ID "0a53".
        </p>
    
        <h2>Command: docker ps -a</h2>
        <p>
            This command lists all the Docker containers, including the stopped ones, on your system.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Command: docker hub and Docker</h2>
        <p>
            Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry that allows you to access and share Docker images. Docker is the platform that enables the creation, deployment, and management of Docker containers.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="container">
      <h1>Kubernetes</h1>
      <img src="./Assets/docker/6.png" width="400">
      <p>
        Kubernetes (also known as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration
        platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of
        containerized applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        It provides a highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant environment
        for running containers across multiple machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure and provides a
        consistent API for managing and interacting with containers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It supports automatic scaling, load balancing, service discovery, and
        rolling updates, making it suitable for running and managing
        production-grade applications.
