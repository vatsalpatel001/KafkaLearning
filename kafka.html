 <!-- Install Kafka and zookeeper on windows

link to download binaray: https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.5.0/kafka_2.13-3.5.0.tgz (100mb)

.tgz is like .zip file

In unzip folder theier is bin, config, libs, licenses and site-docs

in bin/windows theier is bat file will be run using cmd

in config file some configration is their zookeeper.properties, server.properties etc

zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\..\config\zookeeper.properties

kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.properties

kafka-topics.bat --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 3

kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my-topic

kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic my-topic --from-beginning

error and solution
error1: The term 'zookeeper-server-start.bat' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet,
function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the
path is correct and try again., 
solution1: By default, PowerShell restricts the execution of scripts from the current directory to enhance security and prevent accidental execution of malicious scripts. This is known as the "Execution Policy."To run the zookeeper-server-start.bat script from the current directory, you should use the .\ prefix to indicate that the script is located in the current directory. 

eror 2 : The "The input line is too long" error message 
solution 2:If the paths in the command are too long, try moving the Kafka installation directory to a location with a shorter path or rename some directories to shorten the overall path length.

error 3 : The error message "'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command
soultion 3 : download and install Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/ -->

        <h2>Explaining Kafka</h2>
        <ul class="list-group mt-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka:</strong> Imagine it as a special mailbox for your friends to send messages to each other
                efficiently.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Friends:</strong> They can drop their messages into Kafka (the mailbox) instead of sending
                messages directly to each other.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka Topics:</strong> Kafka organizes messages into different categories, like topics in the
                mailbox.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Messages:</strong> Your friends can talk about different things by putting their messages in
                different topics.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Reading Messages:</strong> Everyone can pick up messages from Kafka whenever they want, even if
                they missed some earlier.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka Brokers:</strong> These are like additional mailboxes that keep copies of messages to
                ensure they are safe. If one mailbox stops working, messages are still safe in others.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Kafka is super-efficient and perfect for handling large amounts of
                real-time data reliably.

        <h2>Kafka Terminology</h2>
        <ul class="list-group mt-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka Cluster:</strong> A group of Kafka brokers working together to form a distributed
                messaging system.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka Broker:</strong> A server where Kafka runs, responsible for managing storage, handling
                read and write requests, and replicating messages.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka Producer:</strong> Writes new data (messages) to the Kafka server for distribution to
                topics.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka Consumer:</strong> Reads data from the Kafka server, processing messages from subscribed
                topics.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Zookeeper:</strong> Keeps track of Kafka cluster health, manages configuration information, and
                assists in leader election and coordination.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka Connect:</strong> Facilitates data integration from external entities like databases or
                files into Kafka without writing custom code, offering declarative integration.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Kafka Streams:</strong> Enables data transformation and real-time stream processing within Kafka,
                a lightweight library for building stream processing applications.
            </li>
